Mid-Cycle update to the US Robotics Roadmap.

Through support from the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), the US
National Robotics Roadmap was first created thirteen years ago by a
group of 120 people from industry and academia. It has since been used
by government agencies, universities and companies as a reference and
call to action from the robotics community. The first roadmap was
published in 2009, then revised in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Our objective is to develop a short mid-cycle update, identifying gaps
that are not being addressed in current research, in funding
opportunities, at companies, and in the government, which need to be
addressed sooner than the next full roadmap update. To meet this
objective, we want to engage a broad swath of researchers from
academia and industry to ensure that the update is representative of
the community’s view of what is needed in robotics research so that
national priorities are met.

We are asking researchers to submit a white paper / position statement, 
no longer than two pages, that addresses the following: What are the 
current gaps in robotics research and its ecosystem – and what are 
potential opportunities to fill those gaps? The white paper can focus 
on gaps across sectors or within one sector.

The white paper must include: Name, Title, Affiliation, Email address,
Position statement – 2 pages maximum. Please submit the white paper as
a PDF file. White papers over 2 pages will not be included. Position
papers that present current research are not appropriate. We are most
interested in your ideas, not the format of the paper; if you only
have time to provide us with some general notes, we welcome them. None
of the submissions will be published as-is.

White papers should be submitted by end of day January 9, 2023 – using
the form https://lnkd.in/gqAxzEq4

The submitted white papers will be synthesized for the community update. 
All contributors will be acknowledged, and all ideas will be representative 
of the community, not an individual.

The nominal timeline is:

- November 2022 – Call for white papers
- January 9, 2023 – White papers due
- January / February 2023 – Synthesis of white papers into mid-cycle report
- March 2023 – Report published

If you have any questions about the process, the scope, etc please
send an email to Henrik I. Christensen – hichristensen@eng.ucsd.edu or
Holly Yanco – holly@cs.uml.edu. #robotics #opportunities #research
