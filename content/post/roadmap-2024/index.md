title: "US Robotics Roadmap 2024"
subtitle: "A revision of the national strategy"
summary: "It has been a year in the making, but finally the 2024 version of the ``US
National Robotics Roadmap'' is ready for public consumption. With an amazing team
of collaborators from across the nation we have generated an update to the
document. It takes a village to do the update. We had 100+ white papers
submitted with input about research, business cases and opportunities. The
roadmap is based on three workshops in Philadelphia, Austin and Phoenix. The
world is rapidly changing. Artificial Intelligence is gaining traction and
robotics is the embodiment of these systems. Progress in natural language system
and computer vision allows design of easier to use systems and machine learning
add a new dimension to learning by demonstration and robust autonomy over time.

The roadmap outlines - mega-trends (how the world is changing), major business
opportunities, obstacles to progress, and issues to be addressed in terms of
research, training, and translation.

We gratefully acknowledge the support by host universities, the Computing Community
Consortium (CCC) and the Engineering Visioning Research Alliance (ERVA). Obviously, this work would not have been possible without the broad participation from the community.  

The [2024 roadmap](https://hichristensen.com/pdf/roadmap-2024.pdf) is available
from our web site and shortly also from the CCC and ERVA websites.
