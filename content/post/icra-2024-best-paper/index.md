title: "ICRA 2024 Best Paper"
subtitle: "We won"
summary: "The paper 'Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models' won the ICRA best paper award. This is a fantastic effort to bring together the available dataset on single arm robot manipulation. It involves 20+ manipulators, 500+ tasks, ... THe scale is impressive and sets a new standard for generative manipulation skills"

The paper 'Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning datasets and RT-X Models' won the ICRA best paper award. This is a fantastic effort to bring together the available dataset on single arm robot manipulation. It involves 20+ manipulators, 500+ tasks, ... The scale is impressive and sets a new standard for generative manipulation skills. The learning process involves more than 9TB of data.
