## New Webpage

Welcome to my new home page. I wanted to test use of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Academic](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic) to automate some of the aspects of maintaining a home page. The home page will gradually get more information rich as I learn to leverage the features of Hugo and the Academic template system. As always any and all feedback is most welcome.
