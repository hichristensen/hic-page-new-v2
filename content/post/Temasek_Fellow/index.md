Happy to announce that I am on a partial leave from UC San Diego
April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2026 to be a Temasek Fellow. I will 
work with the group in Singapore on opportunities in Robotics and AI across their portfolio of companies, but also formulate a strategy on robotics and AI opportunities across US, Asia and EU. Very much 
looking forward to having time to think about opportunities and 
challenges across the full eco-system.
