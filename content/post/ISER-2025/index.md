The 19th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER-2025) will take place 6-10 July 2025 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The symposium encourages submission of papers with validation of robotics theory and principles by physical experiments or new experimental paradigms and designs that facilitate theoretical advances. The [website](https://iser2025.org) has details on submission deadlines and will slowly have details on the social program (incl a visit to Los Alamos).
