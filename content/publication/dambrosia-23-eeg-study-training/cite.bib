  ABSTRACT        = {Surgeons operate in mentally and physically demanding
                  workspaces where the impact of error is highly consequential.
                  Accurately characterizing the neurophysiology of surgeons
                  during intraoperative error will help guide more accurate
                  performance assessment and precision training for surgeons and
                  other teleoperators. To better understand the neurophysiology
                  of intraoperative error, we build and deploy a system for
                  intraoperative error detection and electroencephalography
                  (EEG) signal synchronization during robot-assisted surgery
                  (RAS). We then examine the association between EEG data and
                  detected errors. Our results suggest that there are
                  significant EEG changes during intraoperative error that are
                  detectable irrespective of surgical experience level.}
