abstract: "We consider the problem of building an assistive robotic system that can help humans in daily household cleanup tasks. Creating such an autonomous system in real-world environments is inherently quite challenging, as a general solution may not suit the preferences of a particular customer. Moreover, such a system consists of multi-objective tasks comprising â€“ (i) Detection of misplaced objects and prediction of their potentially correct placements, (ii) Fine-grained manipulation for stable object grasping, and (iii) Room-to-room navigation for transferring objects in unseen environments. This work systematically tackles each component and integrates them into a complete object rearrangement pipeline. To validate our proposed system, we conduct multiple experiments on a real robotic platform involving multi-room object transfer, user preference-based placement, and complex pick-and-place tasks. Additional details including video demonstrations of our work are available at https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/home-robot."
