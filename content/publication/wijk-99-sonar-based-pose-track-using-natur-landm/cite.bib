 comment = {Tracking of pose using traingulation points. Based on a pre-stores map consisting of triangulatoin points a set set is used for pose updating, which is fed to a Kalman Filter that enable continuous tracking of the robot pose. The performance of the system is demonstrated using trajectories up to 500 m in length.},
