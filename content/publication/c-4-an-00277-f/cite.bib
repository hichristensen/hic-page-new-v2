 abstract = {In this report, we present a robotic sample
introduction/ionization system for mass spectrometry
(MS) for spot analysis and imaging of non-planar
surfaces. The system operates by probing the sample
surface with an acupuncture needle, followed by
direct plasma chemical ionization time-of-flight
MS.},
