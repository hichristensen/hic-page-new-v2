abstract: In this report, we present a robotic sample introduction/ionization system
  for mass spectrometry (MS) for spot analysis and imaging of non-planar surfaces.
  The system operates by probing the sample surface with an acupuncture needle, followed
  by direct plasma chemical ionization time-of-flight MS.
